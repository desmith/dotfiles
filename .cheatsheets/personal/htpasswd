### Verify that apache2-utils (Debian, Ubuntu) or httpd-tools (RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux) is installed.

# Create a password file and a first user. Run the htpasswd utility with the -c flag (to create a new file), the file pathname as the first argument, and the username as the second argument:

$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user1
#Press Enter and type the password for user1 at the prompts.

# Create additional user-password pairs. Omit the -c flag because the file already exists:

$ sudo htpasswd /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user2
# You can confirm that the file contains paired usernames and encrypted passwords:

$ cat /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
