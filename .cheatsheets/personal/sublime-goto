Goto Anything lets you open any file in a project with just a few keystrokesâ€”it's undeniably one of Sublime's best features. 

But it gets better.

You can combine Sublime's file-specific Goto commands like Goto Line and Goto Symbol with Goto Anything to instantly navigate to any line of code in your project.

You know how some of the Goto commands just open an input overlay with a prefix character, like the : for Goto Line?

By entering that special character when you're using Goto Anything, you can open a file *and* jump right to a line, symbol or search term.

Typing a : after the file name opens the file at the specified line number, so entering "index:42" would open index.html at line 42.

When you enter an @ after a file name, the options list changes to display a list of symbols available in the file. For example, typing "script@ren" might open script.js and jump to a function named "render".

If you append the # symbol to a file name, the options list displays a list of keywords in the file. So inputting "mailspec#send" runs a search in mailbox.spec.js and jumps to the first match for the term send.

And naturally any Goto commands that you combine this way support the fuzzy matching goodness you expect from Sublime.
