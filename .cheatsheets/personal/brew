### Once you’ve got Homebrew installed, you can update Homebrew itself with the command:

brew update

# Now that we’re up to date, we can manage our formulae with Homebrew. I’ll normally install Git, Hugo, Python, Ruby (rbenv), Trash, Yarn and various ZSH plugins; so you’ll see those in my examples.

### Install a formula

brew install git

### Find other formula

# Outside of the standard Homebrew list of formulae, you can access other repositories of formulae for other functions. An example of this would be the Homebrew PHP “tap” which can be installed by accessing three taps:

# https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php#installation
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php

# You will now be able to access a lot of new PHP formulae.


### List installed formulae

# Show the individual packages installed
brew list

# returns:
autoconf    node          rbenv         yarn
gdbm        openssl       readline      z
git         pcre          ruby-build    zsh
hugo        pkg-config    sqlite        zsh-completions
icu4c       python        trash         zsh-syntax-highlighting


# Show each of the full formulae installed

brew leaves

# returns:
git
hugo
python
rbenv
trash
yarn
z
zsh
zsh-completions
zsh-syntax-highlighting

### Find outdated formulae

brew outdated
# If nothing is returned to the terminal, you're up-to-date.

# Update a formula or update everything

# Update a specific formula (e.g. Git)
brew upgrade git

### Upgrade all formula
brew upgrade

### Uninstall a formula

brew uninstall git

### Uninstall everything

brew remove --force --ignore-dependencies $(brew list)

### Clean up old formulae

# List forumlas that can be cleaned up
brew cleanup -n

# Remove all old formulae
brew cleanup

# Remove old symlinks
brew prune

### Get help with formulae

# Homebrew has a built-in doctor which will let you know if everything is working correctly. If not, it will output an error message that you can hopefully use to diagnose the issue.

brew doctor

### Use a GUI
#The alternative to remembering all of these commands is using a GUI. For those who want a GUI, Cakebrew seems to be the best option.  https://www.cakebrew.com/
