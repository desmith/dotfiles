# Rebase often!
git checkout <upstream_branch>
git pull
git checkout -
git rebase <upstream_branch>

# A cool trick is using git fetch --prune. It doesn't require you to checkout to the upstream branch to update it. I love it.

# Here is a list of the ones I use very often:

git cherry-pick
git diff and git apply
git stash
git bisect
