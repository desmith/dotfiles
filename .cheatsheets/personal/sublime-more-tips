### Change the autocomplete key

One thing I don’t like about the autocomplete option is that sometimes they go against you. You are typing your piece of code and when you type Enter or tab, suddenly you get a non-desired function written there. This is why I’m going to explain how you can change that in Sublime Text 3 🙂

We are going to let the autocomplete option only when tab is pressed, and not Enter. Go to Sublime Text –> Preferences –> Key Bindings – User and add the following:

[
    { “keys”: [“enter”], “command”: “commit_completion”, “context”:
        [
            { “key”: “auto_complete_visible” },
            { “key”: “setting.auto_complete_commit_on_tab”, “operand”: false }
        ]
    },
]

Next, go to Sublime Text –> Preferences –> Settings – User and add:

{
“auto_complete_commit_on_tab”: true,
}

Close and open Sublime Text and now, only when you press the tab key, you will autocomplete your functions!

Autocomplete Tip: When you are writing your models in Django, if you simply write Model and press tab (or enter if you didn’t change the autocomplete), a template for a new model will appar. Nice!
