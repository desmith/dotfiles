### "Visual Studio Code is unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace" (error ENOSPC)#
# When you see this notification, it indicates that the VS Code file watcher 
# is running out of handles because the workspace is large and contains many files. 

# The current limit can be viewed by running:
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

# The limit can be increased to its maximum by editing /etc/sysctl.conf and adding this line to the end of the file:
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

# The new value can then be loaded in by running:
$ sudo sysctl -p

# Note that Arch Linux works a little differently, See Increasing the amount of inotify watchers for details.

# While 524,288 is the maximum number of files that can be watched, if you're in an environment 
# that is particularly memory constrained, you may wish to lower the number. 
# Each file watch takes up 1080 bytes, so assuming that all 524,288 watches are consumed, 
# that results in an upper bound of around 540 MiB.

# Another option is to exclude specific workspace directories from the VS Code file watcher 
# with the files.watcherExclude setting. The default for files.watcherExclude excludes node_modules 
# and some folders under .git, but you can add other directories that you don't want VS Code to track.

"files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.git/objects/**": true,
    "**/.git/subtree-cache/**": true,
    "**/node_modules/*/**": true
  }
