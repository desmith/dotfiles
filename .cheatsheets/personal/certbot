### Install

$ wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
$ chmod a+x ./certbot-auto
$ ./certbot-auto --help

# On Ubuntu systems, the Certbot team maintains a PPA. Once you add it to your list of repositories all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.

#$ sudo apt-get update
#$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
#$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
#$ sudo apt-get update
#$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx 

# Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:

$ certbot-auto --nginx

# If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the certonly subcommand:

$ certbot-auto --nginx certonly

### Automating renewal
# The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

$ certbot-auto renew --dry-run

# If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal by adding a cron or systemd job which runs the following:

#$ certbot renew
$ /root/bin/certbot-auto renew

# m h  dom mon dow   command
#  1 8  1   *   * certbot renew
  1 8  1   *   * /root/bin/certbot-auto renew
