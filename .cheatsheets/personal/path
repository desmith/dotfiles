### MacOSX has a truly global path setting that precedes any other setting like ~/.bash_profile. The file /private/etc/paths is a list of pathnames. The order from top to bottom defines the resulting order in the $PATH variable. After loading /private/etc/paths there is a directory /private/etc/paths.d/ with files in the same style. Those are appended to the $PATH variable.

# The default content of /private/etc/paths looks like this:

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin


# The resulting $PATH variable looks like this:

$ echo "$PATH"
# => "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
