# Find your Postfix config file, typically /etc/postfix/main.cf, and add the following:

smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
header_size_limit = 4096000
relayhost = [smtp.sendgrid.net]:587

# Now you need to specify your credentials (optionally, use apikey as username and an API Key as password) in the separate file /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd (you'll likely need to create it):

[smtp.sendgrid.net]:587 yourSendGridUsername:yourSendGridPassword

# Next, make sure the file has restricted read and write access only for root, and use the postmap command to update Postfix's hashtables to use this new file:

$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

# Finally, restart Postfix:

$ sudo systemctl restart postfix
