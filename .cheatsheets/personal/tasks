# Assign a project to your tasks if possible:

 $ task ID modify project:Home

# Assign due dates where appropriate, for the important tasks:

$ task ID modify due:31st

# Don't overdo this though, as a delay might force you to spend too much time reorganizing everything.
 When you start working on a task, mark it started:

$ task ID start

# This is a great reminder after a weekend, of what you were doing on Friday that should be continued.
# If you know the priority of a task:

$ task ID modify priority:M

# But don't fall into the trap of shifting the priorities too often, as you'll waste a lot of time.
# Add useful tags to a task:

$ task ID modify +problem +house

# This is very useful for filtering.
# Add the special tag +next to a task, to boost its urgency:

$ task ID modify +next

# Represent dependencies, where appropriate, because there is a big difference in the urgency of a blocking task, than that of a blocked task:

$ task ID modify depends:OTHER_ID
