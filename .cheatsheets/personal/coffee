npm install -g coffee-script

### To install, first make sure you have a working copy of the latest stable version of Node.js. You can then install CoffeeScript globally with npm:

npm install -g coffee-script

### When you need CoffeeScript as a dependency, install it locally:

npm install --save coffee-script

### If you'd prefer to install the latest master version of CoffeeScript, you can clone the CoffeeScript source repository from GitHub, or download the source directly. To install the latest master CoffeeScript compiler with npm:

npm install -g jashkenas/coffeescript

### Or, if you want to install to /usr/local, and don't want to use npm to manage it, open the coffee-script directory and run:

sudo bin/cake install

### Examples:

    # Compile a directory tree of .coffee files in src into a parallel tree of .js files in lib:
    coffee --compile --output lib/ src/

    # Watch a file for changes, and recompile it every time the file is saved:
    coffee --watch --compile experimental.coffee

    # Concatenate a list of files into a single script:
    coffee --join project.js --compile src/*.coffee

    # Print out the compiled JS from a one-liner:
    coffee -bpe "alert i for i in [0..10]"

    # All together now, watch and recompile an entire project as you work on it:
    coffee -o lib/ -cw src/

    # Start the CoffeeScript REPL (Ctrl-D to exit, Ctrl-Vfor multi-line):
    coffee
