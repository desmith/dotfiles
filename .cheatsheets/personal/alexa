Install ASK CLI

Use npm to install ASK CLI. Run the npm global install command into the ask-cli folder:

$ npm install -g ask-cli

Initialize ASK CLI

The first time you use ASK CLI, you must call the init command to initialize the tool with your Amazon developer account.

$ ask init

You will be prompted to select your profile and to log in to your developer account. Once the initialization is complete, you can use ASK CLI to manage your skills.

Creating a new skill

The ask new command allows you to quickly create a new Alexa skill.

$ ask new --skill-name 'my-skill'
$ cd my-skill
$ ask deploy

This will create a fully working "Hello World" skill that can be enabled and invoked immediately. If you make any subsequent changes, just use ask deploy again to deploy all of your changes.
Working on an existing skill

The ask clone command allows you to set up a local project from your existing skill.

$ ask clone --skill-id 'amzn1.ask.skill.UUID'
$ cd my-existing-skill-name
# make some changes here
$ ask deploy

ask deploy will deploy all of your changes to skill manifest, interaction models, and AWS Lambda function(s).
