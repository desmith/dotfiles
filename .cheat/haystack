### No results found. (On the web page)
Several issues can cause no results to be found. Most commonly it is either not running a rebuild_index to populate your index or having a blank document=True field, resulting in no content for the engine to search on.

Do you have a search_indexes.py located within an installed app?
Do you have data in your database?
Have you run a ./manage.py rebuild_index to index all of your content?
Try running ./manage.py rebuild_index -v2 for more verbose output to ensure data is being processed/inserted.
Start a Django shell (./manage.py shell) and try:

>>> from haystack.query import SearchQuerySet
>>> sqs = SearchQuerySet().all()
>>> sqs.count()
You should get back an integer > 0. If not, check the above and reindex.

>>> sqs[0] # Should get back a SearchResult object.
>>> sqs[0].id # Should get something back like 'myapp.mymodel.1'.
>>> sqs[0].text # ... or whatever your document=True field is.
If you get back either u'' or None, it means that your data isn’t making it into the main field that gets searched. You need to check that the field either has a template that uses the model data, a model_attr that pulls data directly from the model or a prepare/prepare_FOO method that populates the data at index time.
Check the template for your search page and ensure it is looping over the results properly. Also ensure that it’s either accessing valid fields coming back from the search engine or that it’s trying to access the associated model via the {{ result.object.foo }} lookup.
