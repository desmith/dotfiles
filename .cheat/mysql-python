### There are currently a few options for using Python 3 with mysql:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python

    Officially supported by Oracle
    Pure python
    A little slow
    Not compatible with MySQLdb

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymysql

    Pure python
    Faster than mysql-connector
    Almost completely compatible with MySQLdb, after calling pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cymysql

    fork of pymysql with optional C speedups

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient

    Django's recommended library.
    Friendly fork of the original MySQLdb, hopes to merge back some day
    The fastest implementation, as it is C based.
    The most compatible with MySQLdb, as it is a fork
    Debian and Ubuntu use it to provide both python-mysqldb andpython3-mysqldb packages.

### If you get this error when trying to install mysql-python:

Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip-install-Csb9jJ/MySQL-python/

(from: https://zehengl.github.io/2017/12/17/pip-install-mysqlclient-on-macos/)

You would need the mysql connector

You can either install mysql

$ brew install mysql

or, if you don't want to install the full mysql, you can just do this:

$ brew install mysql-connector-c

Modify mysql_config like following:

vi /usr/local/bin/mysql_config

  ```
  # Create options
  libs="-L$pkglibdir"
  libs="$libs -l "
  ```

  should be:

  ```
  # Create options
  libs="-L$pkglibdir"
  libs="$libs -lmysqlclient -lssl -lcrypto"
  ```
