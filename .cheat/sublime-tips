### Goto Anything
Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes,
and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

Triggered with ⌘ P, it is possible to:

- Type part of a file name to open it.
- Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.

These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take you to line 100 of the same file.


### Multiple Selections

$ Press ⇧ ⌘ L to split the selection into lines
$ Press ⌘ D to select the next occurrence of the selected word.
To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection documentation.
